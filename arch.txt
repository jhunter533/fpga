ZU1CG
->PS: TCP Server, Communication
->PL: SNN computation HLS
->AXI Interfaces connecting PS to PL

Block Diagram:
  zu1cg->zynq module
  SNN HLS:
    AXI stream interface (stateIn,actionOut,logprobOut)
    AXI something for weight updates
  AXI Bram controller and bram(unsure if its already part of default setup)
  AXI Interconnect (PS to SNN) (unsure if already part of default)


so how to do the stream interface for real time data flow
how to do the bram
how to connect everything
how to weight load
how to initialize all additional blocks in the application code
how to get right addresses for application code

all this above has  to export the bitstream from Vivado into Vitis and we run TCP server application in Vitis to fpga
