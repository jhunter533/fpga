Actually do good networking
Actor IO: thread 1 half duplex 
queues state,done-> gets action,log_prob
Trainer: thread 2 runs train_step on mini-batches using queue and deque

by separating IO from rest we dont stall while waiting

Have to lock weights for stability to keep the two halves synched between normal call and minibatch
